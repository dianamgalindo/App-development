# Coding Four: Collaborative App Development portfolio

This Repository contains the documentation of the iterative design and development process for an app that is aimed at the Arts Student Union community. This documentation demonstrates development in the areas of graphic design, information visualisation, user experience, and the use of Swift as a medium to bring the app to life.

## Folder structure
- **1. Design and Process Documentation:** This folder contains the presentation done for the formative assignment and the full project documentation, both in PDF format.
The project documentation contains links. It is recommended to right-click and open the links on a new tab.
- **2. Swift code:** This folder contains all the code to build the app. I have made references to code where needed, but the links have also been included under the 'Resources' folder.
- **Resources:** This folder contains references to resources I have used to code certain functionalities within the app. Here, I also include references to some of the icons I have used within the app.

## Requirements
To run the app, download the code and open the **SU_app.xcodeproj** file. This will open Xcode, where you will be able to build the App on the simulator and explore the code.
The app requires the [SwiftUIMargin 0.1.1 package](https://swiftpack.co/package/karamage/SwiftUIMargin).
